# DocumentRecommendations
Albert Einstein once said, "imagination is more important than knowledge."
Human beings are the only creatures we know of that are capable of doing imaginative work. Let's give them more time to do just that.

Records are important. For example, your medical history could help your doctor prescribe a medication for you, and your job resume 
often weighs heavily in a company deciding whether or not you're qualified for a certain role. However, deciding what a document should mean 
for your future does not help you to create that future to the best of your ability. People who create the best version of themselves look forward when deciding
which direction they want to move their life in. Documents are merely a convenience we carry for others. They usually make a decision on us based on our past.

Let's use software to automate the process of deciding what our documents mean for our lives. 
Let's maximize the time we spend worrying about what we - our future decisions, our ability to create a better tomorrow - mean for our lives. 

This project is a proof of concept of such a system. It represents a document manager. 
Users input certain information from their documents, in this case their order form for an automobile service. 
The system stores the information and generates recommendations based on the data, 
for each document from which the user is entering the information.
For example, it will prompt you for the type of vehicle you want service for, the service plan you'd like, 
and based on that output the cost, as well as the time it will take the shop to service your vehicle.

Hope you will contribute!
